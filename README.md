## 🧭 Project Overview
Commercial banks receive thousands of credit card applications each month.  
Manually reviewing them is time-consuming and inconsistent.  
This project uses **supervised machine learning** to automatically predict whether an applicant should be **approved or rejected**, based on their profile data.

**Goal:** Train a classifier to predict credit card approval (binary target).  
**Dataset:** Subset of UCI’s Credit Card Approval dataset.  
**Target column:** Last column in the data frame (`approval_status`).

**Best model:** Random Forest Classifier — accuracy ≈ **0.88**
